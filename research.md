# Preliminary Research

Thousands of accidents happen yearly in construction due to slips and falls, including 300-400 fatal falls. This is partially due to unsafe or harsh terrain/working conditions. One way to reduce your risk of falling is by reducing the amount of time you spend traversing the work site. This is why we are creating a drone to deliver tools and supplies directly to you in expansive and/or dangerous construction sites.

"Falls are a leading cause of injuries and fatalities in construction sites since many construction projects involve working from elevated heights. Regular use of ladders, elevated platforms, and scaffolding exposes construction workers to an increased risk of fall accidents. Unstable surfaces also expose construction workers to fatal fall injuries. Fall hazards associated with susceptible surfaces include uneven terrain, wet floors, and slippery surfaces."

In 2023, out of 1,075 construction fatalities, 421 were due to fatal falls to a lower levelâ€”making falls the leading cause of death in construction for that year.[OSHA data on falls in construction](https://www.osha.gov/stop-falls?utm_source)
